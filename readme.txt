My project is a diver game where the player uses the arrow keys to move the diver, collect coins and 
avoid obstacles. The project uses pygame and is written in python 2.

I downloaded pygame from http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml and used the first link under Macintosh
which is pygame for python 2.7.
