Welcome to Deep Sea Diver!
Guide the diver through obstacles in the sea while collecting gold coins.
Control the diver's movement by using the arrow keys.
Each gold coin collected will increase your score by 10 points.
You can continue playing until all 3 lives have been lost.
The diver loses lives by hitting obstacles in the game.
One life is lost when the diver collides with a shark, anglerfish, or naval mine.
Avoid getting close to anglerfish!
Anglerfish start to follow the diver if it gets too close.
If the diver loses a life, the diver starts blinking for a few seconds.
When the diver is blinking, it is immune to collisions with obstacles.
The diver cannot collect coins when it is blinking.
The diver will also encounter caves during its dive.
Caves present two possible paths for the diver to follow.
Be careful, one of the paths may have obstacles.
Certain parts of the cave will be dark and can hide obstacles.
The diver can turn on a flashlight to see the dark parts of caves.
Press "f" on the keyboard to turn on the diver's flashlight.
Press esc to exit out of the game.
